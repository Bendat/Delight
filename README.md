## Quick Start

1. Import the latest [Delight unity package](https://github.com/delight-dev/Delight/raw/master/Releases/Delight-latest.unitypackage) into your Unity project. 



2. Create a new scene by right-clicking in your project hierarchy and choosing: 

   `Create -> Delight Scene`. 

   Press enter and open the newly created `NewScene.xml`  XML file and edit it so it contains the following content:


   ```xml
   <NewScene xmlns="Delight" 
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="Delight ../Delight.xsd">
     
       <Label Text="Awesome!" />
   
   </NewScene>
   ```
  


3. Open the Unity scene `NewScene.unity` that has been created in the same folder and run it.

Congratulations, you've created your first scene in Delight :).
